# WikiGames

This is a discord bot that will allow you to play games that use information from Wikipedia!

To start a game you have to type `-wikigames` in the channel you want to use, the person who does this will be the gamemaster and will control various aspects of the game, then everyone who wants to play has to type `-join`.

Currently there is only one game: nPeopleAreLying. To play it, the gamemaster needs to type `-start` in chat.

## nPeopleAreLying

This is a game inspired by [Two of These People Are Lying](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfx61sxf1Yz2I-c7eMRk9wBUUDCJkU7H0) from The Thechnical Difficulties.

Everyone will have their article and every round one of those articles will be choosen and everyone will have to pretend that it was his article. One random person will have to question everyone and find who is telling the truth.

When you start the game everyone will recieve a random article from wikipedia in their DMs. You can do 3 things:

* Accept the article given to you by replying `-ready`;
* Reject the article and ask for a new one by replying `-new`;
* Submit your own article replying with `-submit` followed by the article URL.

When everyone is ready, the choosen article and the guesser will appear in the discord channel and its time do play the game!

When the guesser is done and wants to take a guess, you have to type `-guess` and then mention the person he thinks is telling the truth.

Then you'll know if you're right or wrong and get the link of the article. If you want to play again the gamemaster has to type `-play`, a article new article will be sent to the replace the one that was used and the game will start again.
